ATM Machine using Python


ATM Machine Using Python Classes and Objects
This program simulates how the ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) of The XYZ Bank works. Therefore, the program does the following basic ATM requirements:

1. Account creation
2. Check Account Details
3. Check Balance
4. Deposit Amount
5. Withdraw Amount
6. Exit with a transaction receipt

Here, I have created one ATM Class which has following methods:

init: to create instance of an object
Account Details: to check details of account, it will ask for the pin and after verifying your pin, it will show your Account Details
Deposit: to deposit the money in account, it will ask for pin and after verifying your pin, it will add money to you Account
Withdraw: to debit the money from the account, it will ask for pin and after verifying you pin, it will let you withdraw the money from your Account
Check_Balance: it will ask for your pin and after checking your pin, it will display the details of your Account balance
Transaction: it will show you final details of Account after transaction is completed
